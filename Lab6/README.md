# Lab 6

##PART1
*1. Make sure your breadboard is wired according to the prelab. The potentiometer is used to adjust the voltage supplied to the microcontroller for ADC . Design a system that reads the 10-bit ADC result from the ADC register, and displays the result on a bank of 10 LEDs.*

*2. Revise Part 1 by replacing the potentiometer with a photoresistor and 330  ohm resistor. Take note of the highest ADC value displayed when the photoresistor is exposed to light, and the lowest ADC value displayed when the photoresistor is deprived of all light. These values will be used for the remaining lab exercises.*

*3. Design a system where an LED is illuminated if enough light is detected from the photo resistor.*

*4. Design a system, using a bank of eight LEDs, where the number of LEDs illuminated is a representation of how much light is detected. For example, when more light is detected, more LEDs are illuminated.*

Criteria: ● The LEDs should illuminated in sequence from 0 to 7, based on the amount of light detected by the photoresistor.
